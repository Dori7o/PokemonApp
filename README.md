## About The Project

In a 24-hour hackathon themed around childhood nostalgia, our group embarked on a journey to create a captivating experience. Our project? An application that immerses users in the world of Pokémon, allowing them to select their starter Pokémon and engage in thrilling battles to emerge victorious. With each encounter, players must leverage their Pokémon knowledge to overcome challenges and claim victory in their quest to become the ultimate Pokémon Trainer.
